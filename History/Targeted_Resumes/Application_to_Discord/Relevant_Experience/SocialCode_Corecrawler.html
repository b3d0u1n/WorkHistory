<h3 class="first-color">SocialCode Corecrawler</h3>

<p>I was the lead engineer on the data acquisition and publishing subsystem for SocialCode.  The crawler was designed to consume campaign metrics from a various social networks.  The traversals were configured via a small DSL and supported live reconfiguration.  The Crawler pushed data to a gateway entry point that validated the JSON datasets before publishing them to a Kafka bus.</p>
