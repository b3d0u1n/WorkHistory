	<p>The research code was written in Java.  Each statistic was a separate class and these needed to be run on a Hadoop cluster to support the volume of data.  This required moving the functions into the PIG programming language as User Defined Functions (UDFâ€™s).  Since there were data dependencies between several of these functions the integration needed to be deployed as a data-flow-graph.  This was implemented in Oozie.</p>
