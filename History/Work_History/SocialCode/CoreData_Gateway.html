		<i>Technical Details</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>An error dictionary was defined with codes so that the crawler infrastructure could programmatically respond to problems.  If the kafka clients were failing, publishing would be stopped, if validation errors for a data metric were failing crawling for this would pause until the change in expected output was analyzed and properly reflected in the schema validation phase.</p>
