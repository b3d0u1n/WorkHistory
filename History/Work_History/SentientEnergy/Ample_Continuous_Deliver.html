		<i>Objectives</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>Improve internal development and release processes.  Build and test multiple times a day to decouple the enterprise software development cycle from the slower hardware and embedded software testing cycles.  </p>

		<i>Responsibilites</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>I was the primary owner for testing capability.  I worked with the wider team to ensure the unit-tests kept pace with feature development.  Additionally, failures reported during testing were added to the unit-test backlog</p>

		<i>Key Challenges</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>The system can be split into two domains.  The enterprise layer up to the data bus was the portion addressed here.  The challenge was to facilitate testing of the upper-half of the software stack without depending on full end-to-end testing.</p>

		<i>Technical Details</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>Communication between sensor devices and the enterprise layer is asynchronous.  Developing a suite of test-fixtures modeling different messaging scenarios allowed the team to verify two main use cases on the data and command queues.</p>
<p><b>Data acquisition </b></p>
	<blockquote>1.	Processing of cached time series data</blockquote>
	<blockquote>2.	Processing of fault and waveform data</blockquote>
<p><b>Device Configuration and OTAP Upgrade</p>
</b>	<blockquote>1.	Modifying device configuration</blockquote>
	<blockquote>1.	Updating device firmware via OTAP</blockquote>
<p>A queue consumer client tool was developed to ‘emulate’ messages to and from a sensor gateway.</p>

		<i>Project Deliverables</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>The pace of iteration for the enterprise layer was successfully decoupled from the release cycles of the sensor gateway and sensor devices.  Several versions of the system were internally released on a weekly basis.  This accelerated product development and reduced fix-times for reported issues.</p>
