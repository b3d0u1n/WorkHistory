	<p>In the common case, the system was deployed into colocation facilities managed by client power companies.  The Ample platform provides a single entry point to view measurements, status and configurations for the sensor fleets.  Additionally, operators can manage and verify sensor configurations and upgrade the device firmware via OTAP.</p>
<p>The sensors communicate via a radio mesh network and communicate using the DNP3 protocol.  The protocol is point-oriented.  Its primary use is for configuring individual numerical and boolean values.  Commands sent from the Ample interface are consumed by the Sensor Gateways which handle a set of sensors and marshall data to and from DNP3.</p>

<p>Because DNP3 is a connectionless protocol, akin to UDP, and point-oriented, building up data-series datasets required quite a bit of care.  All communication to and from the field is asynchronous and conducted over very low-bandwidth.  Operations to collect time-series data cached on individual devices can take hours and some procedures take days to complete.</p>
<p>As the product line evolved, smaller power companies expressed interest in fleet management over WiFI.  In order to address these use cases, a cloud-based deployment was added to the company’s offerings.</p>
