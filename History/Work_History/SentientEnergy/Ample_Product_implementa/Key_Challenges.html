	<p>Most of quality issues were related to asynchronous communication issues between the Sensor Gateways and the sensor devices.   Failure conditions identified in the testbed were difficult to assess and even harder to reproduce.  Verifying bug fixes was not always deterministic.  Customers were deploying 1000’s of sensors and the internal test beds hosted 10’s.  Scale testing depended on experimental device emulators implemented in software.  </p>
