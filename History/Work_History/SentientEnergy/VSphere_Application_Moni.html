		<i>Key Challenges</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>Restricted access to customer facilities was available from a single virtual image; the Nagios dashboards were not accessible to the ops and dev teams.  Alerts were received via email.  The descriptive content of the alert messages was especially important.  Customer operations teams did not know how to interpret alert events and were not able to take corrective action.  Issues were resolved over the phone with customer teams or by directly accessing the remote installation.</p>

		<i>Technical Details</i>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>Nagios was chosen for monitoring and Perl was used for plugins.  The Nagios Remote Plugin Executor (NRPE) facility was the preferred delivery mechanism.</p>
