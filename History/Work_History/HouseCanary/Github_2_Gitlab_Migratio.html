		<i>Objectives</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>Migrate corporate repositories hosted on GItHub to an internal managed cloud-based GitLab infrastructure to satisfy regulatory requirements from Bank clients.  Several repositories on GitHub were public to support open source initiatives.  Github would continue to be used for these.</p>

		<i>Responsibilites</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>I was solely responsible for migrating 310 repositories from GitHub to GitLab.</p>

<h5 class="sub-project-item fifth-color">
		<i>Key Challenges</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>The entire GitHub repository needed to by copied over to the Gitlab infrastructure.  The new system needed to run as a slave instance to Github.  Errors in migration and replication needed to be investigated and addressed.   </p>

<h5 class="sub-project-item fifth-color">
		<i>Technical Details</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>Github repositories were mirrored into Gitlab, these instances were read-only.  For select users in each engineering group git configurations were adjusted to read from the mirror and push to the active Github repositories.  This allowed teams to verify the integrity of the mirrors and identify problems with data integrity and completeness.</p>
<p>During the cutover I worked with one team at a time to:</p>
	<ul><li>	disable mirroring between the two systems</li>
	<li>	put the GitLab repositories into read-write mode</li>
	<li>	reconfigure the git remote push targets</li>
	<li>	put the teamâ€™s GitHub repositories into read-only mode</li></ul>

		<i>Project Deliverables</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p> After months long testing and verification the entire company was cut over a couple of hours on  Friday afternoon.  There was never any need to revert to the original system.</p>

		<i>Current State</i>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
