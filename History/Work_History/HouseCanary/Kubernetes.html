	<p>Provide a Kubernetes-based system to host DevOps infrastructure.</p>

		<i>Responsibilites</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>I evaluated and prototyped an on-premise Kubernetes cluster.  I needed to ensure that we could guarantee interoperability with our IDP infrastructure running on openIPA/. </p>

<h5 class="sub-project-item fifth-color">
		<i>Key Challenges</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>Support integration with the existing IDP and IAM role system.</p>

		<i>Technical  Details</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>When userâ€™s joined the company they were assigned to a business unit in Namely (https://namely.com/).  These entries were synchronized with FreeIPA/OKTA.  Within the LDAP system Business Unit membership provided additional default group memberships.  These LDAP groups mapped to AWS IAM roles which were assigned to hosts at launch time..  A critical test case was to support these relationships in a Kubernetes environment.   I used DEX (https://github.com/dexidp/dex/blob/master/README.md) to provide a bridge from Kubernetes RBAC roles into our IDP system.</p>

<p>The group name in this RBAC role binding mapped directly to the group in the LDAP system and mapped to the appropriate role in AWS IAM.</p>

		<i>Project Deliverables</i>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>A working prototype with IDP/IAM role integration was demonstrated on an internal Kubernetes cluster. </p>

		<i>Current State</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>This prototype was not deployed to production.  The overall technical direction favored the AWS Elastic Container Service (Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) )) and AWS Elastic Container Registry (Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)).</p>
