	<p>I was responsible for supporting the migration of the terraform code into GitLab and ensuring that all terraform operations were run in the context of the gitlab runners.  A critical aspect of this work was to start the process of converging on a single version of Terraform.  Subsequently, I worked on implementing Terraform Modules to standardize common patterns. </p>
