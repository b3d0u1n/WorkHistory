	<p>When userâ€™s joined the company they were assigned to a business unit in Namely (https://namely.com/).  These entries were synchronized with FreeIPA/OKTA.  Within the LDAP system Business Unit membership provided additional default group memberships.  These LDAP groups mapped to AWS IAM roles which were assigned to hosts at launch time..  A critical test case was to support these relationships in a Kubernetes environment.   I used DEX (https://github.com/dexidp/dex/blob/master/README.md) to provide a bridge from Kubernetes RBAC roles into our IDP system.</p>

<p>The group name in this RBAC role binding mapped directly to the group in the LDAP system and mapped to the appropriate role in AWS IAM.</p>
