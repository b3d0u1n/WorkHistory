		<i>Objectives</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>Ensure that all cloud infrastructure is fully managed by versioned terraform configurations.  Ensure that all terraform applications are managed by the gitlab runner infrastructure.</p>

		<i>Responsibilites</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>I was responsible for supporting the migration of the terraform code into GitLab and ensuring that all terraform operations were run in the context of the gitlab runners.  A critical aspect of this work was to start the process of converging on a single version of Terraform.  Subsequently, I worked on implementing Terraform Modules to standardize common patterns. </p>

		<i>Key Challenges</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>Common resource patterns were not reflected in Terraform.  Each product, sub-system,  resource type had inconsistent implementations.  There were a range of Terraform versions deployed in production which resulted in frequent unintended upgrades to local development environments and occasional applications of these , often breaking, upgrades to production.</p>

		<i>Technical Details</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>The company settled on using multiple AWS accounts.  These accounts mapped to product classes and environments.  For example, front-end products had environments for development, testing, customer verification, staging and production.  The terraform for these environments was essentially the same.  In order to factor out the variables the team added a higher layer of abstraction using Terragrunt.  In the example above, the same terraform could be used for all five environments, the only difference was the environment specific parameter file.</p>

		<i>Project Deliverables</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>Company wide deployments stabilized on a single version of Terraform.  Development of a common set of Terraform modules was started.  These were incorporated into the codebase enabling the team to normalize the Terraform codebase and reduce significant duplication.</p>

		<i>Current State</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>All deployments are managed by Terraform and a standard set of common patterns has been encoded in company specific modules.</p>
