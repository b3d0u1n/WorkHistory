	<i>Objectives</i>
</h4>

<div class="project-item-detail">
	<p>Enable users to build custom search engines.  Support user defined schemas for privately published vertical search data sets.  Provide query blended results combining data from the customer’s vertical search and the Inktomi web crawler.</p>
</div><h4 class="project-item third-color">
	<i>Key Challenges</i>
</h4>

<div class="project-item-detail">
	<p>The backend for this service was deployed as a service oriented system to accommodate the asynchronous behavior of the indexing and query pipelines.  There was existing code written in various languages, owned by different teams, which needed to be coordinated.  End users needed to be able to observe the progress of schema definition and indexing processes.  </p>

	<i>Technical Details</i>
</h4>

<div class="project-item-detail">
	<p>The backend for this service was deployed as a service oriented system with RabbitMQ as the bus.  The components were written in different languages, Java, C, C++ and Erlang interacted with MySQL, VESPA, and the larger web crawling infrastructure.  Coordination of schema validation, vertical search instance configuration and the processing of uploaded structured data was managed by a central workflow manager implemented as a distributed state machine.  Inspectability of the incremental progress through the system allowed the UI to publish progress as data was loaded, or query result sets were fetched and merged from VESPA and the Web crawling infrastructure.  RabbitMQ as a message bus for command and data channels.  This allowed us to leverage the various components and developers could work with their preferred technology.  </p>
<p>The VESPA vertical search engine technology is in the same family as Lucene and SOLR.   Once a published schema was validated, a vertical search index was created.  Data feeds published to the index were validated against the inferred types in the published schema before being loaded into the search engine.  The product allowed 3rd parties to leverage the Yahoo!/Inktomi search engine.  Additionally, users could define their own structured data schema which allowed them to publish structured data and host it in a bespoke Vespa instance.  Query results could be a blend of structured results and open search results returned by the Yahoo!/Inktomi search API. </p>

	<i>Project Deliverables</i>
</h4>

<div class="project-item-detail">
	<p>The product was launched with support for user defined vertical indexes.  Queries combined hits from the customer’s indexes and hits from the Yahoo! Search engine.</p>

	<i>Current State</i>

<div class="project-item-detail">
	<p>The service was shutdown in 2016.</p>
