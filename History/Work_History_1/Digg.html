	<i>Responsibilites</i>
</h4>

<div class="project-item-detail">
	<p>Improve visibility into the recently deployed infrastructure.  This effort focussed on OpenTSDB as the recorder for performance metrics generated across the micro-services layer.</p>

	<i>Key Challenges</i>
</h4>

<div class="project-item-detail">
	<p>Digg had completed a significant migration of its backend systems from MySql to Cassandra.  This resulted in stability and performance issues.  There was a wide range of additional technologies under the hood.  Understanding the feature to tech-stack mappings and instrumenting the system to collect metrics grouped by call stacks was challenging.  One goal was to leverage OpenTSDB to capture reliable time series information to improve visibility of overall system performance.</p>
<p>A second goal was to remain competitive in the social news space at a time when Facebook was entering the social news market.  Digg was an early integrator with the new OpenGraph news offering from Facebook.</p>

	<i>Technical Details</i>
</h4>

<div class="project-item-detail">
	<p>The social news integration with Facebook was implemented on their OpenGraph.</p>
</div><h4 class="project-item third-color">
	<i>Project Deliverables</i>
</h4>

<div class="project-item-detail">
	<p>I integrated Digg data into the Facebook OpenGraph to support a ‘social reader’.  Facebook had an initial launch of this new facility  with a selected group of participating companies.</p>
</div><h4 class="project-item third-color">
	<i>Current State</i>
</h4>

<div class="project-item-detail">
	<p>The original company was dissolved.  The IP was sold to LinkedIn, the engineering team went to SocialCode in an acquihire, and the brand was sold off to a 3rd party.  It remains an active product.</p>
