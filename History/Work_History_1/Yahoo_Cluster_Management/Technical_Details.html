	<i>Technical Details</i>
</h4>

<div class="project-item-detail">
	<p>Machines booted via PXE and installed a remote agent.  This agent would manage multiple virtual environments configured as chroot jails.  Additional Yahoo proprietary virtualization and package managers were incorporated into the base-builds.</p>
<p>Zookeeper was used as the controller.  The implementation needed to support the following scenarios</p>

	<blockquote>1)	provide a persistent store of configuration information</blockquote>
	<blockquote>2)	provide a reliable means of signaling state change information to trigger deployments</blockquote>
	<blockquote>3)	provide a reliable means of signalaing success or failure of a requested operation</blockquote>
	<blockquote>4)	provide a means to indicate the completion of a set of work</blockquote>
	<blockquote>5)	handle cases of incremental node addition</blockquote>
	<blockquote>6)	prove that the routine always ends up in a completed state [ i.e. no more work in progress ]</blockquote>
	<blockquote>7)	provide an audit trail for a given node configuration - i.e. log the set of ip addresses for auditing purposes.</blockquote>
