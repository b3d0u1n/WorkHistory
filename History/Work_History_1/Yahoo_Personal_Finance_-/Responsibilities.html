	<p>I was responsible for maintaining the banking infrastructure while adding new functionality.  As sole owner I was responsible for hardware, monitoring, deployment and interfacing with the product and security teams.  I was also tasked with migrating the data storage from an early Yahoo! Proprietary no-sql datastore into MySql.  During this migration I also needed to change the encryption method from Triple DES to AES.</p>
