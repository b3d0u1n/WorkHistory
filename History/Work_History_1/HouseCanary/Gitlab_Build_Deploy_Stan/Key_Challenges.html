		<i>Key Challenges</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>At the start of the project the following approaches were being used:</p>
	<ul><li>	Running Ansible from a local laptop with uncommitted playbooks</li>
	<li>	Checking code out directly to deployed AMIâ€™s and building in production </li>
	<li>	Updating production AMI dependencies by hand </li>
	<li>	Deploying docker containers via AWS ECR</li>
	<li>	Developing code on Vagrant images </li>
	<li>	Applying uncommitted terraform by hand</li></ul>
<p>This set the following obligations:</p>
	<ul><li>	Support building docker, vagrant and AMI images</li>
	<li>	Centralize terraform code and guard against concurrent apply operations</li>
	<li>	Collect all local automation and manual processes, translate them into Gitlab CI</li>
	<li>	Get sign-off from all engineering groups </li></ul>
