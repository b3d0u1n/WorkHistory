		<i>Objectives</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>Maintain a central console of deployed sensor networks.  Enhance  graphs for sensor monitoring statistics, device configuration management and endpoint software upgrades.  Provide map views of sensor deployments.  </p>

		<i>Responsibilites</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>I was responsible for managing the development team.  This was a 3rd party group, and the  majority of the team was in Bangalore.  I worked to communicate product and management expectations for feature development and was the owner of the bug queue.  </p>

		<i>Key Challenges</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>Most of quality issues were related to asynchronous communication issues between the Sensor Gateways and the sensor devices.   Failure conditions identified in the testbed were difficult to assess and even harder to reproduce.  Verifying bug fixes was not always deterministic.  Customers were deploying 1000’s of sensors and the internal test beds hosted 10’s.  Scale testing depended on experimental device emulators implemented in software.  </p>

		<i>Project Deliverables</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>Product improvements and bug fixes were pushed several times a week.  The sensor deployment maps were a new feature that was delivered to production.   </p>
