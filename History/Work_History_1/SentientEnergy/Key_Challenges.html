	<i>Key Challenges</i>
</h4>

<div class="project-item-detail">
	<p>The companyâ€™s primary line of business is designing and building hardware devices.  Development cycles are long and testing is very intensive.  A key goal was to decouple the software development cycle from the hardware verification testing cycle.  Development of the enterprise software layer needed to accelerate with faster iterations and reduce testing times.  Automated testing during the Jenkins build process was enhanced and internal release cycles were shorted.  </p>
<p>Deployments to customer environments were infrequent and were not well automated or easily reproducible.  A significant effort was made to build out a robust set of Ansible playbooks.  Stabilizing these deliveries was a key goal of the management team.</p>
<p>We relied on VMWare virtualized environments to host the system.  Providing reliable monitoring of the underlying virtualization layer was another critical task.</p>
<p>Finally, communication between teams supporting hardware development, enterprise software, testing and management was extremely demanding.  Coordination overhead was a constant challenge to manage.</p>
