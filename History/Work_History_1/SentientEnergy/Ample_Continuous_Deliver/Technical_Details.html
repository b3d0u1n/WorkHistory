	<p>Communication between sensor devices and the enterprise layer is asynchronous.  Developing a suite of test-fixtures modeling different messaging scenarios allowed the team to verify two main use cases on the data and command queues.</p>
<p><b>Data acquisition </b></p>
	<blockquote>1.	Processing of cached time series data</blockquote>
	<blockquote>2.	Processing of fault and waveform data</blockquote>
<p><b>Device Configuration and OTAP Upgrade</p>
</b>	<blockquote>1.	Modifying device configuration</blockquote>
	<blockquote>1.	Updating device firmware via OTAP</blockquote>
<p>A queue consumer client tool was developed to ‘emulate’ messages to and from a sensor gateway.</p>
