	<i>Objectives</i>

<div class="project-item-detail">
	<p>Implement DevOps best practices to accelerate the Enterprise platform development.  Minimize deployment failures.  Provide additional support for mobile sensors by developing a cloud-based deployment system.</p>
</div><h4 class="project-item third-color">
	<i>Responsbilities</i>
</h4>

<div class="project-item-detail">
	<p>I managed a distributed development team as well as a remote team of DevOps contractors.  I was responsible for working with the management, product and QA teams, Customer success and 3rd party points of contact  to improve internal build, testing, deployment and monitoring processes.  </p>
</div><h4 class="project-item third-color">
	<i>Key Challenges</i>
</h4>

<div class="project-item-detail">
	<p>The company’s primary line of business is designing and building hardware devices.  Development cycles are long and testing is very intensive.  A key goal was to decouple the software development cycle from the hardware verification testing cycle.  Development of the enterprise software layer needed to accelerate with faster iterations and reduce testing times.  Automated testing during the Jenkins build process was enhanced and internal release cycles were shorted.  </p>
<p>Deployments to customer environments were infrequent and were not well automated or easily reproducible.  A significant effort was made to build out a robust set of Ansible playbooks.  Stabilizing these deliveries was a key goal of the management team.</p>
<p>We relied on VMWare virtualized environments to host the system.  Providing reliable monitoring of the underlying virtualization layer was another critical task.</p>
<p>Finally, communication between teams supporting hardware development, enterprise software, testing and management was extremely demanding.  Coordination overhead was a constant challenge to manage.</p>

</div><h4 class="project-item third-color">
	<i>Technical Details</i>
</h4>

<div class="project-item-detail">
	<p>In the common case, the system was deployed into colocation facilities managed by client power companies.  The Ample platform provides a single entry point to view measurements, status and configurations for the sensor fleets.  Additionally, operators can manage and verify sensor configurations and upgrade the device firmware via OTAP.</p>
<p>The sensors communicate via a radio mesh network and communicate using the DNP3 protocol.  The protocol is point-oriented.  Its primary use is for configuring individual numerical and boolean values.  Commands sent from the Ample interface are consumed by the Sensor Gateways which handle a set of sensors and marshall data to and from DNP3.</p>
<p>
<img src="SentientEnergy/Technical_Details.jpg" alt="" >
</p>

<p>Because DNP3 is a connectionless protocol, akin to UDP, and point-oriented, building up data-series datasets required quite a bit of care.  All communication to and from the field is asynchronous and conducted over very low-bandwidth.  Operations to collect time-series data cached on individual devices can take hours and some procedures take days to complete.</p>
<p>As the product line evolved, smaller power companies expressed interest in fleet management over WiFI.  In order to address these use cases, a cloud-based deployment was added to the company’s offerings.</p>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>Most of quality issues were related to asynchronous communication issues between the Sensor Gateways and the sensor devices.   Failure conditions identified in the testbed were difficult to assess and even harder to reproduce.  Verifying bug fixes was not always deterministic.  Customers were deploying 1000’s of sensors and the internal test beds hosted 10’s.  Scale testing depended on experimental device emulators implemented in software.  </p>

		<i>Key Challenges</i>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
