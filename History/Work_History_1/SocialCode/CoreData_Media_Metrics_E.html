		<i>Objectives</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>Provide access to campaign statistics published by third party social networks.  Product teams could define calculations over the raw statistics to quickly generate client specific data sets.</p>

		<i>Responsibilites</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>I defined the DSL for this REST interface.  Users could install simple formulas to calculate compound metrics.  The interface hosted an expression parser to calculate these additional metrics on the fly.</p>

<h5 class="sub-project-item fifth-color">
		<i>Key Challenges</i>
</h5>

<div class="sub-project-detail">
	<p>Allow userâ€™s, primarily product, to access data using their own naming.  The system needed to support easy aliasing of campaign metrics and compound metrics specified by the product team.</p>

<p>This interface was implemented in TastyPie <a href="https://tastypieapi.org">http://tastypieapi.org</a> and was a solid effort to follow the HATEOS architectural style.   A principle integration point was the Facebook OpenGraph API which followed this pattern as well.  Critical inspiration came from: </p>
